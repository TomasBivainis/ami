# TODO

Here are some areas for improvement in your Go code:

1. **Error Handling Consistency**

- Some error messages are generic ("Command error:") and could be more descriptive.
- Inconsistent use of `return` after printing errors (sometimes missing, sometimes present).

1. **Command Construction**

- In the `install` command, you use `strings.Join(args, " ")` as a single argument to `exec.Command`. This passes all packages as one argument, not as separate arguments. Instead, use variadic arguments:
  ```go
  exec.Command(pipCommand, append([]string{"install"}, args...)...)
  ```

1. **Requirements File Handling**

- `addPackagesToRequirementsFile` appends packages without a trailing newline, which may cause formatting issues.
- No deduplication: repeated installs will duplicate package names in `requirements.txt`.

1. **Detecting Python and Pip**

- `detectPip` falls back to using `python -m pip` as a string, but this is not split into command/args when used with `exec.Command`.
- If `pip` is not found, the error message could suggest how to install it.

1. **Filepath Variable Shadowing**

- In `detectFile`, you use `filepath := filepath.Join(...)`, which shadows the imported `filepath` package. Use a different variable name.

1. **Unused Imports**

- The `strings` package is only used in one place; consider importing it only if needed.

1. **Code Formatting**

- Unnecessary semicolons (e.g., `return path, nil;`)—Go style omits these.
- Some functions use parentheses for return types (e.g., `func createRequirementsFile() (error)`)—should be `func createRequirementsFile() error`.

1. **General Robustness**

- No check for the existence of a virtual environment before creating one.
- No feedback to the user after successful operations (e.g., after creating `requirements.txt`).

1. **Concurrency and Performance**

- Not a major issue here, but if you plan to extend, consider concurrency safety for file writes.

1. **Testing**

- No unit tests provided for the helper functions.

1. **MAKE IT USE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT**

- Make the program use the virtual python environment.
